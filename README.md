# üß† NeuroNest - Memory Palace Builder

Transform your learning with AI-powered memory palaces that turn concepts into unforgettable visual journeys.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Stories**: Convert any list of concepts into vivid, memorable stories using Google's Gemini AI
- **Personal Library**: Save, organize, and revisit all your memory palaces in one place
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts with encrypted password storage using SQLite
- **Responsive UI**: Beautiful, animated interface built with Streamlit
- **Local Database**: All data stored locally using SQLite - no external dependencies

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Why uv?**
- **Faster**: 10-100x faster than pip for package resolution and installation
- **Better dependency resolution**: More reliable than pip
- **Built-in virtual environment management**: Simplifies project setup
- **Drop-in pip replacement**: Same commands, better performance

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv package manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- Google AI API key (Gemini)

### Installation

1. **Install uv package manager** (if you haven't already)
   ```bash
   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # On Windows
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # Or via pip
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroNest.git
   cd NeuroNest
   ```

3. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.9+
   uv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

   **Alternative with pip:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Get your Google AI API Key**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Make sure virtual environment is activated
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The app will automatically create the SQLite database (`neuronest.db`) on first run.

## üìö How It Works

### The Memory Palace Technique

NeuroNest uses the ancient "Method of Loci" or Memory Palace technique, enhanced with AI storytelling:

1. **Input Concepts**: Enter the topics you want to remember (one per line)
2. **AI Story Generation**: Gemini AI creates a vivid, connected story placing concepts in different "rooms"
3. **Visual Memory**: The story creates mental images linking your concepts in a memorable palace
4. **Personal Library**: All your palaces are saved locally for easy access and review

### Example Usage

**Input concepts:**
```
Photosynthesis
Mitochondria
Cell Membrane
Chloroplast
DNA
```

**AI generates a story** like:
> **Room 1: The Sunlight Kitchen**
> In the first room of your memory palace, you walk into a bright kitchen where **Photosynthesis** is the chef. She's a green-skinned woman wearing a apron made of leaves, frantically cooking using only sunlight as her heat source...

The story continues, connecting each concept in a memorable, visual narrative.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

```
NeuroNest/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main Streamlit application & UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_agent.py         # AI integration (Gemini API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.py              # SQLite database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env               # Environment variables (create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ neuronest.db       # SQLite database (auto-created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file
```

## üìÅ Database Schema

The SQLite database automatically creates two tables:

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    password_hash TEXT
)
```

### Palaces Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE palaces (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    concepts TEXT,
    story TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Required Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:
```txt
streamlit>=1.28.0
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### Environment Variables

Only one environment variable is required:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google AI Studio API key

   - Check that you have quota remaining on your Google AI account

2. **Database Errors**
   - Delete `neuronest.db` file and restart the app to recreate the database
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory

3. **Import Errors**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Verify you're using the correct virtual environment

4. **Streamlit Issues**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try running in incognito/private mode
   - Check console for JavaScript errors

### Performance Tips
